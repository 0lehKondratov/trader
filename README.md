# Trader-AI

## Principles
Depending on what type of trading the AI will conduct, different input data will be more relevant. In the case of swing trades, 4 hour time blocks over 180 days will provide the best long term information. Similarly, for day trading a 1 day 1 minute timeframe will be more useful. As such, two independent models should be trained for these separate styles of trading.
